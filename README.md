I've been working for quite some time for a client to get the website about their [weight loss center Pensacola](http://optihealthweightloss.com/) ranked. It's all about quality links, I don't like PPC and I think ranking in organic searches is priceless.

They have a new project and a new website that I have to build and I am very interested in doing it with Rails, even though I am not on a Mac. From what I heard, it is more difficult to do things in Windows, but everything is possible with a little but of effort.

I like GitHub very much, there are so many things I can learn around here, which is the main reason why I dared to start such a difficult task. I also heard that sites built on this platform can rank faster and I really want to test this.
